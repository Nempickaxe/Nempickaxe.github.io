        Using the biadjacency matrix \(A^{(b)} =(A_{li}) ∈\{0, 1\}^{n_t×n_p} \)
        to represent the product-purchase network, where \( n_t \) is the number
        of transaction nodes, \( n_p \) is the number of product nodes, and \(
        A_{li} =1\) if product \(i\) is purchased in transaction \(l\) and 0
        otherwise.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>n<sub>t</sub> is the number of transaction nodes</li>
        <li>n<sub>p</sub> is the number of product nodes</li>
        <li>
          A<sub>li</sub> = 1 if product i is purchased in transaction l, and 0
          otherwise
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Assumptions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Complements are products that appear in the same transactions
          significantly more frequently than expected.
        </li>
        <li>
          The degree of complementarity between complements is positively
          correlated with how frequently they co-occur in transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Substitutes are products that share the same complements but appear in
          the same transactions significantly less frequently.
        </li>
        <li>
          The degree of substitutability between substitutes is positively
          correlated with how similar their complements are.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <h2>Null Model Approach</h2>
    <p>
      This section explains how to create two simple networks to identify 
      complementary and substitute relationships between products. These networks are built from sales data and represent how products are purchased together.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First, we create a network called a bipartite product-purchase network. 
        Here, two types of nodes are used: 
        <strong>transactions</strong> (representing individual purchases) 
        and <strong>products</strong> (items bought in those transactions).
      </li>
      <li>
        In this network, a line (or edge) connects a transaction node to a product node 
        if that product was included in the transaction. From this, we analyze how products 
        are linked through shared transactions to identify their relationships.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How We Identify Important Relationships</h3>
    <p>
      To find meaningful connections between products, the idea of 
      <strong>common neighbors</strong> is introduced. This means looking at how often two products appear in the same transaction.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If two products are bought together in the same transaction, they share 
        a <strong>common neighbor</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        To determine if this shared connection is significant, we use 
        <strong>null models</strong>. These models help us compare the observed connections to what we would expect by chance.
      </li>
      <li>
        If two products are bought together much more often than expected, 
        they are likely <strong>complements</strong>. If they are bought together less often than expected, they are likely <strong>substitutes</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To do this, two specific null models are proposed:</p>

    <h4><strong>Variant of Bipartite Erdős–Rényi (ER) Models</strong></h4>
    <p>
      This model provides a simple way to estimate relationships between products 
      by assigning each product a unique probability of being connected to a transaction. 
      This probability is called \( p_i \) for product \( i \).
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want to calculate the chance that two products, \( i \) and \( j \), 
      are connected to the same transaction, we multiply their individual probabilities:
    </p>
    <p>\( p_i p_j \)</p>
    
    <h5>Counting Shared Transactions</h5>
    <p>
      The number of transactions that involve both products \( i \) and \( j \) 
      is called \( c_{nij} \). In this model, it behaves like a random variable, \( X_{ij} \), 
      that follows a binomial distribution:
    </p>
    <p>\[ X_{ij} \sim \text{Binomial}(n_t, p_i p_j) \]</p>
    <p>Here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>\( n_t \): Total number of transactions.</li>
      <li>\( p_i p_j \): The probability of a transaction containing both products \( i \) and \( j \).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Making Predictions Easier</h5>
    <p>
      For a large number of transactions (\( n_t \)), we can simplify this binomial 
      distribution using the Central Limit Theorem. The distribution of \( X_{ij} \) 
      can be approximated by a normal distribution:
    </p>
    <p>\( N(\mu_{ij}, \sigma_{ij}^2) \)</p>
    <p>The parameters of this normal distribution are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>\( \mu_{ij} = n_t p_i p_j \): This is the expected number of shared transactions (mean).</li>
      <li>\( \sigma_{ij}^2 = n_t p_i p_j (1 - p_i p_j) \): This is the variability (variance).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Finding Significant Relationships</h5>
    <p>
      To decide if two products are significantly more or less connected than expected, 
      we compare the observed \( c_{nij} \) to the expected mean and variability. 
      Significance thresholds are set using \( \alpha_m \) (for "more") and \( \alpha_l \) 
      (for "less"). The rules are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Significantly More:</strong> \( c_{nij} \) is higher than expected if:
        <p>
          \( c_{nij} > n_t p_i p_j + \Phi^{-1}(1 - \alpha_m) \sqrt{n_t p_i p_j (1 - p_i p_j)} \)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Significantly Less:</strong> \( c_{nij} \) is lower than expected if:
        <p>
          \( c_{nij} < n_t p_i p_j - \Phi^{-1}(1 - \alpha_l) \sqrt{n_t p_i p_j (1 - p_i p_j)} \)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Here, \( \Phi^{-1}(·) \) is the function used to find significance thresholds 
      from a standard normal distribution.
    </p>
    
    <h5>How Are Probabilities Estimated?</h5>
    <p>
      Each product's connection probability (\( p_i \)) is calculated using data. 
      We estimate \( p_i \) with:
    </p>
    <p>\( \hat{p}_i = \frac{d_i^{(p)}}{n_t} \)</p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>\( d_i^{(p)} \): The number of transactions that include product \( i \).</li>
      <li>\( n_t \): Total number of transactions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This method ensures that our probabilities reflect real purchase behavior, 
      making it easier to analyze product relationships.
    </p>    

    <h4><strong>Bipartite Configuration Models (BiCMs)</strong></h4>
    <p>
      The Bipartite Configuration Model (BiCM) is a method for creating random bipartite networks while maintaining specific degree sequences. It improves upon the simpler ER model by considering the variability in transaction node degrees (basket sizes) and product node degrees (popularity).
    </p>
    
    <h5>How BiCM Works</h5>
    <p>
      BiCM assigns a predefined number of "stubs" (half-edges) to each node, corresponding to its degree. These stubs are randomly connected to ensure edges form only between transaction and product nodes. Key terms include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>\( d_l^{(0)} \):</strong> Degree of a transaction node \( l \).</li>
      <li><strong>\( d_i^{(1)} \):</strong> Degree of a product node \( i \).</li>
      <li><strong>\( m \):</strong> Total edges in the network (sum of all node degrees).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Edge Formation Probability</h5>
    <p>
      For a stub of transaction node \( l \), the probability of connecting to any of the \( d_i^{(1)} \) stubs of product node \( i \) is:
    </p>
    <p>
      \[
      \frac{d_i^{(1)}}{m}
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
      With \( d_l^{(0)} \) stubs for transaction node \( l \), the probability of forming an edge is approximately:
    </p>
    <p>
      \[
      p_{li} = 1 - \left( 1 - \frac{d_i^{(1)}}{m} \right)^{d_l^{(0)}} \approx \frac{d_l^{(0)} d_i^{(1)}}{m}
      \]
    </p>
    
    <h5>Probability of Common Neighbors</h5>
    <p>
      The probability of two product nodes \( i \) and \( j \) sharing a common transaction node \( l \) is given by:
    </p>
    <p>
      \[
      p_{ilj}^{(1)} = \frac{d_l^{(0)} d_j^{(1)} (d_l^{(0)} - 1) d_i^{(1)}}{m^2}
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of common neighbors between product nodes \( i \) and \( j \), denoted \( c_{nij} \), is the sum of probabilities over all transaction nodes:
    </p>
    <p>
      \[
      c_{nij} = \sum_{l=1}^{n_t} \text{Bernoulli}(p_{ilj})
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
      This follows a Poisson binomial distribution:
    </p>
    <p>
      \[
      X_{ij} \sim \text{PoissonBinomial}(p_{i1j}, p_{i2j}, ..., p_{in_tj})
      \]
    </p>
    
    <h5>Mean of the Distribution</h5>
    <p>
      The mean \( \mu_{ij} \) is calculated as:
    </p>
    <p style="border: 2px solid #007BFF; background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; width: 60%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
        \[
        \mu_{ij} = \frac{d_i^{(p)} d_j^{(p)}}{m} \cdot \frac{\langle d^{(t)2} \rangle - \langle d^{(t)} \rangle}{\langle d^{(t)} \rangle}
        \]
    </p>  
    <ul>
      <li>\( d_i^{(p)} \), \( d_j^{(p)} \): Degrees of product nodes \( i \) and \( j \).</li>
      <li>\( \langle d^{(t)} \rangle \): Average transaction node degree.</li>
      <li>\( \langle d^{(t)2} \rangle \): Average squared transaction node degree.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: bold; background-color: #fff3cd; border: 2px solid #007BFF; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
        This marks a major breakthrough! The right side of the equation, which depends on transactions, is constant for every product pair. As a result, the expected mean is exclusively determined by the product of the product pair degrees, enabling the modeling of the simulation using Spark.
    </p>    
    
    <h5>Poisson Approximation</h5>
    <p>
      For sparse networks, the Poisson binomial distribution can be approximated as a Poisson distribution:
    </p>
    <p>
      \[
      Y_{ij} \sim \text{Poisson}(\mu_{ij})
      \]
    </p>
    
    <h5>Significance Testing</h5>
    <p>
      Use the Poisson cumulative distribution function \( F_{ij}(y) \) to test for significant deviations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Significantly more:</strong> \( 1 - F_{ij}(c_{nij}) < \alpha_m \)</li>
      <li><strong>Significantly less:</strong> \( F_{ij}(c_{nij}) < \alpha_l \)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Here, \( \alpha_m \) and \( \alpha_l \) are the significance levels, and \( F_{ij}(y) \) is given by:
    </p>
    <p>
      \[
      F_{ij}(y) = e^{-\mu_{ij}} \sum_{k=0}^y \frac{\mu_{ij}^k}{k!}
      \]
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This model helps identify product pairs with statistically significant transaction patterns, highlighting potential complementary or substitute relationships.
    </p>    

    <h3>Constructing Unipartite Networks</h3>
    <p>
      This section discusses the construction of two unweighted unipartite networks based on significance tests applied to the number of common neighbors. Each network represents a specific type of product relationship.
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Network \(A^{(m)}\):</strong> 
        This network is represented by the adjacency matrix \(A^{(m)}\) and captures products that are bought together significantly <strong>more</strong> frequently than expected. 
        An element \(A_{ij}^{(m)}\) equals 1 if the number of common neighbors between products \(i\) and \(j\) is significantly higher than what the null model predicts, and 0 otherwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Network \(A^{(l)}\):</strong> 
        This network, represented by the adjacency matrix \(A^{(l)}\), identifies products that are purchased together significantly <strong>less</strong> frequently than expected. 
        An element \(A_{ij}^{(l)}\) equals 1 if the number of common neighbors between products \(i\) and \(j\) is significantly lower than the null model prediction, and 0 otherwise.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      Based on these networks and assumptions about complementary and substitute relationships, two additional networks are constructed:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Complementary Network \(A^{(c)}\):</strong> 
        This network is represented by \(A^{(c)}\) and indicates complementary product pairs. 
        An element \(A_{ij}^{(c)}\) is 1 if products \(i\) and \(j\) are complements, meaning they have significantly more common neighbors. 
        Essentially, this network is the same as \(A^{(m)}\): \(A^{(c)} = A^{(m)}\).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Substitute Network \(A^{(s)}\):</strong> 
        This network, represented by the adjacency matrix \(A^{(s)}\), signifies substitute relationships. 
        An element \(A_{ij}^{(s)}\) is 1 if products \(i\) and \(j\) are substitutes. 
        This network is derived from both \(A^{(m)}\) and \(A^{(l)}\).
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Specifically, the relationship between these networks is defined as follows:</p>
    <p>
      \[
      A^{(s)} = I_{\{(A^{(m)})^T A^{(m)} > 0\}} \odot A^{(l)}
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
      In this equation, products are classified as substitutes only if they share at least one common complement (indicated by \((A^{(m)})^T A^{(m)} > 0\)) and are purchased together significantly less often (indicated by \(A^{(l)}\)).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The indicator matrix \(I_{\{(A^{(m)})^T A^{(m)} > 0\}}\) plays a crucial role by filtering out product pairs that don't meet the shared complement criteria.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      These unipartite networks simplify the representation of complex purchasing patterns, making it easier to identify and analyze product relationships within a large dataset.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Discounting Larger Baskets in Complementarity Calculation</h3>
    <p>
      The authors propose a method to identify and quantify the strength of complementary relationships between products using sales data. The key idea is to analyze how frequently products are purchased together while considering the size of the shopping baskets.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To address the issue of larger baskets potentially skewing the analysis, the authors incorporate a discounting factor based on transaction size. The formula for calculating the complementarity score, denoted as \(simo(i, j)\), is given by:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      \[
      simo(i, j) = \frac{\sum_{l=1}^{n_t} \frac{A_{li}A_{lj}}{d(t)_l}}{\sqrt{\left( \sum_{h=1}^{n_t} \frac{A_{hi}}{d(t)_h}\right) \left( \sum_{h=1}^{n_t} \frac{A_{hj}}{d(t)_h}\right)}}
      \]
    </p>
    
    <p>In this formula:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>\(n_t\) is the total number of transactions.</li>
      <li>
        \(A_{li}\) is an element from the biadjacency matrix \(A^{(b)}\) of the product-purchase network. It equals 1 if product \(i\) was bought in transaction \(l\), and 0 otherwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        \(d(t)_l\) indicates the degree of transaction node \(l\), which represents the number of products purchased in that transaction.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <strong>The critical aspect is the term</strong> \(\frac{1}{d(t)_l}\) <strong>within the summation.</strong> 
      This term serves as a discounting factor, diminishing the contribution of transactions with a larger number of products (larger baskets). 
      If two products co-occur in a basket with many other items, their co-purchase may be coincidental. 
      By dividing by the transaction degree, the formula downweights the significance of these larger baskets. 
      Conversely, co-purchases in smaller baskets, where \(d(t)_l\) is smaller, receive a higher weight, as they are more likely to represent genuine complementarity.
    </p>
    
    <h3>From Significance Matrix A to Weighted Matrix W</h3>
    <p>
      The transition from the significance matrix \(A\) to the weighted matrix \(W\) involves two key steps:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Identifying Significant Relationships:</strong> 
        The authors utilize null models to determine statistically significant relationships, either complementary or substitutable, between products. 
        This results in unweighted unipartite networks represented by matrices \(A^{(m)}\) and \(A^{(l)}\). 
        These matrices indicate the presence of significant relationships but do not quantify their strength.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Quantifying Relationship Strength:</strong> 
        The authors calculate the strength or degree of these relationships using the formulas \(simo\) (for complementarity) and \(sims\) (for substitutability). 
        This step converts the unweighted matrices \(A^{(c)}\) (for complementarity) and \(A^{(s)}\) (for substitutability) into weighted matrices \(W^{(c)}\) and \(W^{(s)}\), respectively.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      The weighted adjacency matrix of the complement unipartite network, \(W^{(c)}\), is derived as follows:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      \[
      W^{(c)} = A^{(c)} \odot simo(i,j)
      \]
    </p>
    
    <p>where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        \(\odot\) denotes the element-wise (Hadamard) product of matrices.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <strong>In essence, the significant relationship matrix</strong> \(A^{(c)}\) <strong>acts as a filter.</strong> 
      The complementarity score, calculated using \(simo\), is only assigned to product pairs that have been identified as having a statistically significant complementary relationship according to the null model. 
      This ensures that the weighted matrix \(W^{(c)}\) reflects both the presence and strength of complementarity between products.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Calculating Substitutability Using <code>sims(i, j)</code></h3>
<p>
    The authors introduce a method to quantify how substitutable products are for one another. The main idea is that 
    <strong>products that share similar patterns of complementarity with other products are likely substitutes</strong>. 
    For example, if both <strong>Brand A</strong> coffee and <strong>Brand B</strong> coffee are complementary to coffee filters and sugar, they are likely substitutes for each other.
</p>

<p>
    To measure this, the authors use cosine similarity, which compares vectors of complementarity scores. For each product, a vector is created where each element represents the complementarity score (calculated using <code>simo</code>) between that product and all other products. The formula for the substitutability score, denoted as \(sims(i, j)\), between products \(i\) and \(j\) is:
</p>

<p>
    $$ 
    sims(i, j) = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n_p} W^{(c)}_{ik} W^{(c)}_{jk}}{\sqrt{\left( \sum_{p=1}^{n_p} {W^{(c)}_{ip}}^2 \right) \left( \sum_{p=1}^{n_p} {W^{(c)}_{jp}}^2 \right) }} 
    $$
</p>

<p>In this formula:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(n_p\) represents the total number of products.</li>
    <li>
        \(W^{(c)}_{ik}\) denotes the complementarity score between product \(i\) and product \(k\), calculated using a measure like <code>simo</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>This formula calculates the cosine of the angle between the complementarity score vectors of products \(i\) and \(j\).</strong> 
    A smaller angle (higher cosine similarity) indicates a stronger alignment in their complementarity patterns, suggesting that the two products are more likely substitutes.
</p>

<p>
    Just like how the significance matrix \(A^{(c)}\) was used to filter complementarity scores, the significance matrix \(A^{(s)}\) is used to filter substitutability scores. The weighted adjacency matrix of the substitute unipartite network is calculated as follows:
</p>

<p>
    $$ W^{(s)} = A^{(s)} \odot sims(i,j) $$
</p>

<p>In this equation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        \(\odot\) represents the element-wise (Hadamard) product of matrices.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>This process ensures that substitutability scores are only calculated for product pairs that show a statistically significant substitute relationship according to the null model, as indicated by \(A^{(s)}\).</strong> 
    The resulting matrix, \(W^{(s)}\), provides a quantitative measure of the strength of the substitutable relationships between products.
